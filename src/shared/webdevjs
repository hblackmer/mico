        question: "What are the pros and cons of client-side rendering? What are the pros and cons of server-side rendering?",
        answer: "The main advantage of client-side rendering is the fast speed, after the initial page load. The biggest disadvantages are poor SEO performance and the possibility of poor user experience on slower devices. The main advantages of server-side rendering are that visual elements of the page load quickly, and it offers better SEO performance compared with client-side rendering. The primary disadvantage is the time it takes for interactive elements of the page to load can be slow and depends largely on factors outside of the developer's control.",
